									<h2>Who is <br />
									Grace Phillips?</h2>
									<p>Hello reader! My name is Grace Phillips and I am currently a senior, and almost graduate, at Seton Hill University (B.S.
									Computer Science). I am originally from the Pittsburgh area, but I am currently a resident of the Greensburg area. Over
									the past four years of my academic career, I have had the opportunity to have a well-rounded education within the
									Computer Science courses and the Liberal Arts Curriculum. My main goal for my career is to continuously develop my
									skills within the technology world and strive to push myself in everything I do. Anyone should be interested in me as an
									employee because I have been consistently praised as diligent by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic,
									extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven communication, teamwork, and multitasking skills which I hope
									to continuously prove throughout my career.</p>

										<h2>Course: Programming 1 <br />
												 </a></h2>
										</header>
										
										<p>This project was the final project that I completed within the programming 1 course and the purpose was to accumulate
										several skills learned throughout the entirety of the course into a program. It was up to each individual student to how
										they wanted to style the topic of their program. I completed this project by using NetBeans, an IDE for Java, and basic
										beginner skills like incorporating user input, for-loops, if/then statements, etc.</p>

										<h2>Course: Programming 2 <br />
												</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>This assignment was a part of the programming 2 course and the purpose of this assignment was to show the understanding
										of animation and usage of setting specific features on images using Xcode. I was able to complete this assignment by
										using Xcode, importing images, testing with the built-in simulator feature, and using Xcode given functions.</p>

										<h2>Course: App Dev with Data Structures<br />
										
									</header>
									
									<p>The purpose of this assignment was to generate random values into an Array and Linked List of the same values. Then it
									was tasked for individuals to design an algorithm to sort the contents of both the Array and Linked List and record the
									time it took for the numbers to result back in ascending order. I was able to complete this by using Eclipse, an IDE for
									Java, and the skills of using the Random Generator function, creating Arrays, and creating Linked Lists.</p>

										<h2>Course: Computer Ethics<br />
										
									</header>
									
									<p>The purpose of this assignment was to do research on a case about Copyright infringement and respond, from an ethical
									point of view, if the Copyrighted material was truly infringed on. I was able to complete this assignment by researching
									through outside sources, taking class notes and comparing definitions, and responding as honest as I saw fit.</p>

										<h2>Course: Analysis of Mobile Software Systems<br />
									
									</header>
								
									<p>The purpose of this assignment was to create a full, well-rounded systems analysis plan for a potential new application
									for some business of the individualâ€™s choosing. I was able to complete this project by taking into account creating a
									project plan, UML diagrams and their relationships, use case examples, data management, and app previews.</p>

										<h2>Course: Algorithms Analysis<br />
									</></h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>This project was assigned as a group project that each member of the group had to specifically add their own part to.
									The task at hand was to create a Mario Kart simulator where the player, or user, could do 3 laps around the course, have
									the chance to get a power up boost, and the option to use it or not. All of these cases would vary the times on each
									lap. I was able to complete this project by using Eclipse, an IDE for Java, skills from previous courses, and taking into consideration the time aspect of this assignment.</p>
